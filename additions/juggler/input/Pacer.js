/**
 * Plays a humanize plan on its own schedule. The one pacing rule for every
 * engine.
 *
 * Each step carries `t`, milliseconds from the start of the action, and waits
 * until `start + t`, not a gap after the previous step's ack. Waiting a full
 * gap after each ack added every ack's latency to the action: on a page busy
 * 19ms in every 20, moves planned at 0.5s took 0.54-0.71s
 * (tests/patches/humanize-pacing.py). A late ack delays only its own step; the
 * ones after it are still due on the original clock.
 *
 * No Gecko imports at module scope: this module also runs under Node for the
 * unit tests, with `clock` and `sleep` supplied.

 *   the plan fast-forwards to its end state (below).
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {AbortSignal} [options.signal] stops the plan; nothing more dispatches.
 * @param {number} [options.deadlineMs] once this long has passed since the

 *   input slot for long.
 * @returns {Promise<{outcome: 'ok'|'fast_forward'|'aborted',
 *   dispatched: Array<{i: number, tPlanned: number, tActual: number}>}>}
 *
 * Fast-forwarding skips the waits and every remaining step that is not
 * `essential`, but always dispatches the last step: a move still ends exactly
 * on its target, and a step that carries part of the requested effect (a wheel
 * notch, a key) is still delivered.
