/**
 * The cursor path `humanize=True` moves along.
 *
 * Camoufox used to generate this in C++ (additions/camoucfg/MouseTrajectories.hpp):
 * a cubic Bezier through two random knots, distorted, then walked with an
 * ease-out and emitted at a flat 10ms cadence. It was replaced by Cursory
 * (cursory/, vendored) because the two differ in what they are imitating. A
 * Bezier is an equation, and an equation sampled at a fixed rate has velocity
 * and jerk profiles that separate cleanly from a hand's; the old path's speed
 * also came entirely from an easing function, so every movement Camoufox ever
 * made accelerated and decelerated the same way. Cursory replays one of 2357
 * movements recorded from real people, morphed onto the requested endpoints,
 * and keeps that recording's own timing -- pauses, overshoots and all.
 *
 * This module is the whole boundary between Camoufox and Cursory: it owns the
 * cadence and the pixel grid, and is the base `cursory` mouse engine behind the
 * humanize seam (HumanizeSeam.js), which hands it the options and the seeded
 * stream and plays the plan it returns.

 * a 60Hz display -- and it is the rate the recordings themselves carry (median
 * gap across all 110664 of their samples: 16ms). Asking for more would not add
 * information, only more synthesized events per move, each of which costs a
